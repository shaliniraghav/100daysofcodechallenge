📌Topic:-Array
📌Subtopic:-1-bit 2-bit Character
📌Description:-We have two special characters:
The first character can be represented by one bit 0.
The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).
Given a binary array bits that ends with 0, return true if the last character must be a one-bit character.

📌Testcase 1:
Input: bits = [1,0,0]
Output: true
Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character.
So the last character is one-bit character.

📌Testcase 2:
Input: bits = [1,1,1,0]
Output: false
Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character.
So the last character is not one-bit character.
 

📌Constraints:-
1 <= bits.length <= 1000
bits[i] is either 0 or 1.
  
📌Code:- 
class Solution {
    public boolean isOneBitCharacter(int[] bits) {
        int n = bits.length, i = 0;
        while (i < n - 1) {
            if (bits[i] == 0) i++;
            else i += 2;
        }
        return i == n - 1;
    }
}
