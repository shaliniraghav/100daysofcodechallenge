ğŸ“ŒSubtopic:Longest Continous Increasing Subsequence
ğŸ“ŒDescription:Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence (i.e. subarray). The subsequence must be strictly increasing.
A continuous increasing subsequence is defined by two indices l and r (l < r) such that it is [nums[l], nums[l + 1], ..., nums[r - 1], nums[r]] and for each l <= i < r, nums[i] < nums[i + 1].

ğŸ“ŒTestcase 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5] with length 3.
Even though [1,3,5,7] is an increasing subsequence, it is not continuous as elements 5 and 7 are separated by element
4.

ğŸ“ŒTestcase 2:
Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2] with length 1. Note that it must be strictly
increasing.
 
ğŸ“ŒConstraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

ğŸ“ŒCode:
class Solution {
    public int findLengthOfLCIS(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length==0) return 0;
        int length=1,temp=1;
        for(int i=0; i<nums.length-1;i++) {
            if(nums[i]<nums[i+1]) {temp++; length=Math.max(length,temp);}
            else temp=1; 
        }
        return length;
    }
}
