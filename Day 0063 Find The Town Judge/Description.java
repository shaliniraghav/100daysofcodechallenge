📌Topic: Array
📌Subtopic: Find the Town judge
📌Description:In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.
If the town judge exists, then:
The town judge trusts nobody.
Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi. If a trust relationship does not exist in trust array, then such a trust relationship does not exist.
Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.

📌Testcase 1:
Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2

📌Testcase 2:
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3

📌Testcase 3:
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1
 

📌Constraints:
1 <= n <= 1000
0 <= trust.length <= 10^4
trust[i].length == 2
All the pairs of trust are unique.
ai != bi
1 <= ai, bi <= n

📌Code:
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

class Solution {
    public int findJudge(int n, int[][] trust) {
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<Integer>();
        Set<Integer> judge = new HashSet<Integer>();
        if(trust.length == 0 && n==1){
            return 1;
        }
        else if(trust.length == 0){
            return -1;
        }
        for(int i = 0; i<trust.length; i++){
            set.add(trust[i][0]);
            judge.add(trust[i][1]);
        }
        judge.removeAll(set);
        if(judge.isEmpty() || judge.size() > 1) {
            return -1;
        }
        int judgeId = judge.iterator().next();
        int judgeTrust = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i<trust.length; i++) {
            if(trust[i][1] == judgeId) {
                judgeTrust++;
            }
        }
        if(judgeTrust == n-1) {
            return judgeId;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
